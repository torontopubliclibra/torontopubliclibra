Making neat things on the internet was a hobby for most of my life before it became my career in 2020. These days, I primarily build websites and apps for businesses and non-profit organizations. I'm very passionate about accessible and equity-centered design, free and open-source software, data privacy, and projects that intersect with advocacy (particularly for queer and trans communities).

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:contact@danateagle.com) if you have a question about any of my apps or websites, or if there's a project or opportunity you think I'd be a particularly good fit for! You can find my latest portfolio at [dana teagle dot com](https://danateagle.com) and in most other places online I'm known as [the Toronto Public Libra](https://danateagle.com/alt).
