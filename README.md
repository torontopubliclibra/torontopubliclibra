Making neat things on the internet was a hobby for most of my life before it became my career in 2020. I currently work with clients on a contract basis, primarily building websites and apps for businesses and non-profit organizations. These days I'm most passionate about accessible and equity-centered design, free and open-source software, data privacy, and projects that intersect with advocacy (particularly for queer and trans communities).

Please feel free to [get in touch](mailto:dana.r.teagle@gmail.com) if you have a question about any of my apps or websites, or if there's a project or opportunity you think I'd be a particularly good fit for. I also love to hear from other developers, so if you have any feedback or suggestions for me, I'd be happy to hear them. You can find my latest portfolio at [dana teagle dot com](https://danateagle.com) and in most other places online I'm known as [the Toronto Public Libra](https://danateagle.com/alt).
