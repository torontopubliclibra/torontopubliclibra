I've been making websites and apps for fun for most of my life, and professionally since 2020. You can find my portfolio at [dana teagle dot com](https://danateagle.com) and in most other places online I'm known as [the toronto public libra](http://torontopubliclibra.com). Please feel free to [reach out](mailto:dana.r.teagle@gmail.com) if you have a question about any of my apps or websites, if there's a project or opportunity you'd like to discuss with me, or if you just want to talk comic books, Star Wars, trans history, or '90s indie rock.
