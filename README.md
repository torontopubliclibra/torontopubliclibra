I'm a web/software developer from Toronto, Ontario, Canada. I've been making websites and apps for fun for most of my life, and professionally since 2020.
<br/><br/>
I graduated from Juno College in 2022, and my recent work has included web design projects, social media management, and contract software development. These days, what particularly excites me is accessible design, open source development, and projects that intersect with queer & trans advocacy.
<br/><br/>
Before I started coding full time, I cooked in vegetarian restaurants, managed caf√©s and bakeries, and edited short films. I also have experience consulting on technical solutions for small businesses, and leading community workshops.
