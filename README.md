I'm Dana Rosamund Teagle (she/her), a Web/Software Developer from Toronto, Ontario, Canada. I've been making sites and apps for fun for most of my life, and professionally since 2020. You can check out my portfolio site <a href="https://danateagle.com">here</a>.
<br/><br/>
I graduated from Juno College of Technology in 2022, and my recent work has included web design projects, social media management, and contract software development. These days, what particularly excites me is open source, accessible design, and projects that intersect with 2SLGBTQAI+ advocacy.
<br/><br/>
Before I started coding full-time, I cooked in vegetarian restaurants, managed caf√©s and bakeries, and edited short films. I also have experience consulting on technical solutions for small businesses, and leading workshops within queer & trans communities in Toronto.

Please feel free to reach out if you want to chat about one of my projects, if you have an opportunity in mind for me, or if you just want to talk Star Wars, comic books, trans history, or '90s indie rock.
