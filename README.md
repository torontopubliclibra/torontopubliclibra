 I've spent most of my life making neat things on the internet, between creating graphics, designing and developing websites and software, managing social media, and editing video content. These days, I primarily work as an independent contractor for businesses, freelance professionals, and non-profit organizations. I'm especially passionate about accessible equity-centered design, user-friendly interfaces, and open-source software, as well as projects that intersect with advocacy (particularly for queer and trans communities).
