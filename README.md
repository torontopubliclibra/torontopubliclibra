Making neat things on the internet was a hobby for most of my life before it became my job in 2020. In every field I've ever found myself working in though, I've always been a problem-solver first and foremost. I'm passionate about accessible design, open source development, data privacy, and projects that intersect with advocacy work (particularly for the queer and trans communities). Please feel free to [email me](mailto:dana.r.teagle@gmail.com) if you have a question about any of my apps or websites, or if there's a project or opportunity you think I'd be a particularly good fit for. You can find my portfolio at [dana teagle dot com](https://danateagle.com) and in most other places online I'm known as [the toronto public libra](http://torontopubliclibra.com).
