I've been making websites for fun for most of my life, and professionally since 2020. These days, what particularly interests me is open-source software, functional and accessible design, as well as projects that intersect with queer & trans advocacy. Before I worked in tech, I spent good chunks of my time editing short films, and cooking in professional kitchens. If I'm away from my computer, chances are I'm on a long walk around the city, taking photos of pigeons, reading library books, or making playlists.
