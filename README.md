Making neat things on the internet was a hobby for most of my life before it became my career in 2020. In every field I've ever found myself working in though, I've always been a problem-solver first and foremost. At the moment, I find myself most passionate about accessible design, open source development, data privacy, and projects that intersect with advocacy (particularly for the queer and trans communities). Please feel free to [email me](mailto:dana.r.teagle@gmail.com) if you have a question about any of my apps or websites, or if there's a project or opportunity you think I'd be a particularly good fit for. If you want to send me any encrypted communications or documents, my OpenPGP public key can be found [here](https://danateagle.com/data/rusty-pgp.asc). You can find my latest portfolio at [dana teagle dot com](https://danateagle.com) and in most other places online I'm known as [the toronto public libra](http://torontopubliclibra.com).
