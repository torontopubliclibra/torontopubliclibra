Making neat things on the internet was a hobby for most of my life before it became my career in 2020. In every field I've ever found myself working in though, I've always been a problem-solver first and foremost. I enjoy working with a variety of languages, frameworks, libraries, and technologies, and I am constantly striving to pick up new skills and learn different ways of doing things. At the moment, I find myself most passionate about accessible design, open source development, data privacy, and projects that intersect with advocacy (particularly for queer and trans communities).

Please feel free to [get in touch](mailto:dana.r.teagle@gmail.com) if you have a question about any of my apps or websites, or if there's a project or opportunity you think I'd be a particularly good fit for. I also love to hear from other developers, so if you have any feedback or suggestions for me, I'd be happy to hear them. You can find my latest portfolio at [dana teagle dot com](https://danateagle.com) and in most other places online I'm known as [the Toronto Public Libra](https://danateagle.com/alt).
