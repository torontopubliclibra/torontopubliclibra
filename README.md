I'm Dana Rosamund Teagle (she/her), a Front-End Developer from Toronto, Ontario, Canada. I've been making websites for fun for most of my life, and professionally since 2020. These days, what particularly interests me is open-source software, functional and accessible design, as well as projects that intersect with 2SLGBTQAI+ advocacy.
<br/>
I graduated from Juno College of Technology in 2022, and some of my recent work has included freelance web design and social media management, as well as contract development projects with Parallel 42 Systems.
<br/>
Before I worked in tech, I spent good chunks of my time editing short films, cooking in professional kitchens, and managing restaurants and caf√©s. I also have experience with both technical consulting and also leading workshops for the queer & trans community in Toronto.
