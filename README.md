Making neat things on the internet was a hobby for most of my life before it became my career in 2020. In every field I've ever found myself working in though, I've always been a problem-solver first and foremost. I enjoy working with a variety of languages, frameworks, libraries, and technologies, and I am constantly striving to pick up new skills and learn different ways of doing things. At the moment, I find myself most passionate about accessible design, open source development, data privacy, and projects that intersect with advocacy (particularly for the queer and trans communities).
