I've been making websites and apps for fun for most of my life, and professionally since 2020. You can check out my portfolio <a href="https://danateagle.com">here</a>.
<br/><br/>
I graduated from Juno College of Technology in 2022, and my recent work has included web design projects, social media management, and contract software development. These days, what particularly excites me is accessible design, open source development, and projects that intersect with queer and trans advocacy.
<br/><br/>
Before I started coding full-time, I cooked in vegetarian restaurants, managed caf√©s and bakeries, and edited short films. I also have experience consulting on technical solutions for small businesses, and leading community workshops.
<br/><br/>
Please feel free to reach out if you have a question about any of my apps or websites, if there's a project or opportunity you'd like to discuss with me, or if you just want to talk comic books, Star Wars, trans history, or '90s indie rock.
