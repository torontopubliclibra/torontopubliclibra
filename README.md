I've spent most of my life making neat things on the internet, between developing websites and software, designing graphics and posters, managing social media, and editing video content. I'm especially passionate about hand-coded websites, accessible equity-centered design, user-friendly interfaces, and open-source software, as well as projects that intersect with advocacy.
